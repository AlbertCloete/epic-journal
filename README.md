# Epic Journal

A free cross-platform encrypted daily journal / diary app, with full CSS styling. It is built with Sqlite3 and 
SQLcipher with AES 256 CBC encryption.

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/alangrainger/epic-journal/releases/latest).

I built it as a free and open replacement for *The Journal* by DavidRM, which I have used 
for many years. The main issues I wanted to solve were better styling, and the ability to know that my
entries are safe for the long-term, with an open and known database format.

## Features

- Fast and clean Electron app
- AES 256 CBC encryption
- Single journal file that you can store in your Dropbox, or wherever you like
- Custom style types
- Pure HTML5 compatible
- Syntax highlighting
- Insertable templates
- Tagging
- Image support
- Active development

## Usage

#### Using templates

To create a template, click the Go menu, and then Edit Templates. Give your template a name and fill in some text
and it will auto-save it for you.

To insert a template, right-click anywhere in an entry and choose Insert Template. 

#### Editing your own styles

Click Go > Edit Styles.

The editor I'm using is TinyMCE, and it requires you to specify if it's a block or inline level element.
If you wanted to make a highlighted span class, you'd set it up like this:

- Element: `span`
- Type: `inline`
- Class name: `myclass`
- Style: `background-color: yellow;`

This page needs a bit of work, but any styles you set up here will persist into future versions.

## Upcoming features

I'll be working towards feature parity with The Journal, but the next things I'm working on are:

- Mobile app (nothing fancy, just to add entries on the go)
- Search. Good fast search.
- Multiple folders. They will be tabs above the editor - think of them as master categories.
- Linking between entries
- Minimise to tray, and hotkey open
- Notes folder â€“ i.e. non date-related entries
- Emoji support

## Building

### Windows

- `yarn install`

- `yarn run dev`

- `yarn run build`

### MacOS

**NOTE: I haven't yet got unix-sqlcipher to compile properly on Mac. If you know how, let me know!** 

There is an unresolved issue with cross-sqlcipher and yarn, 
so the source files are set up for my Windows dev machine.

To build on MacOS, you will need to make two changes:

1. In `package.json`, change `"win-sqlcipher": "^0.0.4"` to be `"unix-sqlcipher": "^0.0.4"`

1. In `src/main/datastore.js`, replace 'win-sqlcipher' with 'unix-sqlcipher'.

Then build as above:

- `yarn install`

- `yarn run dev`

- `yarn run build`
